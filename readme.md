# Project Title

Playing around with Folktale, a little bit of Ramda, and an idea I had for working with tables that have
all their data. I might update this _the proverbial someday_ to deal with tables that make requests
for their data. Who knows..?

## Getting Started

This isn't released to npm, so if you really want to use it, you'll have to fork it for now. Again, _someday_
I might get around to making it an npm package.


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
