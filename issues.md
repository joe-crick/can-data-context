# Issues

1. Understand Bx of DefineList - Lists get nested. Converting to a typed List, the List loses all its members.
2. Calling the join property seems to be calling .toString() on the function.
3. Default values for DefineMap props don't seem to be showing up. Prop values only show up if I pass them in.
4. How to pass functions in to a DefineMap (cell and header middleware). Why is `forEach` not a method on the List?
5. Properties of the table not moving between components, though two-way binding is set up.
